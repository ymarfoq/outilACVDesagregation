Description: 
        bcolz provides columnar and compressed data containers.  Column
        storage allows for efficiently querying tables with a large number of
        columns.  It also allows for cheap addition and removal of column.  In
        addition, bcolz objects are compressed by default for reducing
        memory/disk I/O needs.  The compression process is carried out
        internally by Blosc, a high-performance compressor that is optimized
        for binary data.
