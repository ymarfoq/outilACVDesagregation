# conda-js-backbone

Provides Backbone `Model`s and `Collection`s that use `conda-js` under the
hood, using either the REST or RPC modes.

Differences from normal Backbone:

- Each `Model` has a `conda` attribute providing access to the underlying
  `conda-js` object.
- Backbone methods will trigger `conda-js` methods as appropriate, but not
  vice-versa.
